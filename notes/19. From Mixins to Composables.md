## From Mixins to Composables
Imagine a Home component where clicking a button triggers a flash message. Using the Options API, you might have a method like this:

```js
methods: {
  flash(message) {
    alert(message);
  }
}
```
In the template:

```html
<button @click="flash('It works!')">Click me</button>
```
This works fine on the Home page, but if you want the same flash functionality on the About page, you might be tempted to copy and paste the method there. This leads to duplication and potential inconsistencies, especially if you later change the implementation (for example, switching from alert to a library like SweetAlert).

### Introducing Mixins
A traditional way to solve this in Vue 2 (and still supported in Vue 3, though less favored) is using mixins. Mixins allow you to define reusable code that can be "mixed in" to components.

**Create a mixins directory and add a Flash.js file:**

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    flash(message) {
      alert(message);
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in your component, import and use the mixin:

```js
import Flash from '@/mixins/Flash';

export default {
  mixins: [Flash],
  // other component options
}
```

Now, both Home and About components can use the flash method without duplication.

However, mixins have drawbacks. When multiple mixins are used, it can become unclear where certain methods or data come from, especially in large components. This is similar to the confusion traits can cause in PHP. Good IDEs can help, but it's still a potential source of confusion.

### Composables: The Recommended Approach
A more modern and recommended approach is to use composables, which are plain functions that encapsulate reusable logic.

**Create a composables directory and add useFlash.js:**

```js
import Swal from 'sweetalert2';

export function useFlash() {
  function flash(message, title = '', icon = 'success') {
    Swal.fire({
      title,
      text: message,
      icon,
    });
  }

  return { flash };
}
```

In your component, `import` and use the composable inside the setup function:

```js
import { useFlash } from '@/composables/useFlash';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { flash } = useFlash();

    function handleClick() {
      flash('It works!', 'Success', 'success');
    }

    return { flash: handleClick };
  }
}
```

In the template:

```html
<button @click="flash">Click me</button>
```

Using `<script setup>` syntax, this can be simplified further by moving the composable call to the top level.

This approach centralizes your flash message logic in one place, making it easy to update and maintain. Both Home and About pages can import and use the same composable, ensuring consistency.

### Summary
Mixins provide a way to reuse code but can lead to unclear codebases when overused.
Composables are plain functions that encapsulate reusable logic and are the preferred method in Vue 3.
Composables promote clearer, more maintainable code and better reuse.
