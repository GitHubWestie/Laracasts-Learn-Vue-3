## Say Hello to Pinia
To get Pinia installed and initalised follow the getting started in [Pinias docs](https://pinia.vuejs.org/getting-started.html)

In fact the Pinia docs use a very similar example to this Laracasts lesson so ccould basically be followed as they are.

### Terminology
---
Pinia uses terminology like `state`, `actions`, `getters` etc. These arent anything new, they just have a different name. 

```js
const terminology = {
    'state': 'data',
    'actions': 'methods',
    'getters': 'computed properties'
}
```

And so on...
