## Vue 3 Absolute Basics
Simplest way to get started with Vue 3 is to pull it in via cdn
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
```

Vue then needs to be initialised. Inside the <body> tags add:
```html
<!-- Create an element for Vue to mount to -->
<div id="app"></div>

<script>
    // Mount to the element using it's id
    Vue.createApp({}).mount('#app');
</script>
```
 Vue will only be able to interact with elements *inside* the element it's mounted to.

 To actually render something on the page Vue needs some data to work with.

 ```html
    <div id="app">
        {{ greeting }}
    </div>
        
    <script>
    Vue.createApp({
        data() {
            return {
                greeting: 'Hello world!',
            };
        }
    }).mount('#app');
    </script>
 ```

 Regular JavaScript syntax can be used with Vue too. For example `{{ greeting.length }}` will render the string length.

 It also massively simplifies things which would take years off of your life with vanilla JS. For example `v-model`:
 ```html
<p>
    <input type="text" v-model="greeting">
</p>
 ```
 In this instance the value of the input will be the greeting. But when the input value is changed, `v-model` will change the value of greeting instantly and update the DOM to reflect that new value.
