## Direct Mutation Concerns
Direct mutation can be a concern for larger projects. For smaller projects it's generally ok and remember the KISS methodology. It only needs to be as complicated as it needs to be to get the job done. That said in Vue's own documentation it is recommended that methods are used for mutatioon instead of mutating states directly. 

### Direct Mutation
---
In this example the value of counter.count is directly mutated using the button.
```html
<template>
    <div>
        <h1>{{ counter.count }}</h1>

        <button @click="counter.count++">Increment</button>
    </div>
</template>
```

Instead a method should be used. This can be achieved using a store.

### Method Mutation
By adding a method or `action` to the store  we can avoid mutating the state directly. This also has the benefit of having a name by which the method can be referenced which can make it easier to read and see what's going on.

```js
import { reactive } from "vue"

export let counter = reactive({
    // state/data
    count: 0,

    // action/method
    increment() {
        this.count++;
    } 
})
```

This way we can also add extra functionality such as guard logic and even debug easier because there is a single action responsible for incrementing the value.
