## Named Slots
Named slots are useful when a component requires more than one slot. They can be named so that they can be explicitly set as needed and Vue will know which slot should be used for which content.

### Naming a Slot
Slots are named using the `name` attribute:
```html
<slot name="heading" />
```

To use a named slot requires the `template` tag and the v-slot directive
```html
<template v-slot:heading>Put me in the slot!</template>
```

### v-slot shorthand
The v-slot attribute can be shortened to just a '#'
```html
<template #heading>Put me in the slot!</template>
```

### Rendering Slots
A slot will be rendered regardless of if it has content in it or not. To prevent this the `$slots` variable can be used to set a condition on element. The `$slots` property is provided by Vue and contains all slotted content.
```html
<h1 v-if="$slots.heading">
    <slot name="heading" />
</h1>
```

This way the heading will only be rendered *if* the slot is used.
