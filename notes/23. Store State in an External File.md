## Store State in an External File
Instead of passing data around it can also be stored in one central location that all components can easily access. This is a common approach and is particularly useful for things like shopping carts where many components may need access to various attributes in the cart.

These files are usually called `stores` and live inside a `/stores` directory in the `src` directory. Then the files within it would be responsible for holding state.

```js
// src/stores/quizStore.js
<script setup>
export const state = {
    name: 'My Quiz',
    questions: [
        // Quiz questions
    ],
    // other state properties...,
}
</script>
```

Now any component that needs to work with data in the store can simply import it.

```js
<script>
import {state} from '@/stores/quizStore';
</script>
```

### Make it Reactive
---
To make the state reactive it can be wrapped in the `reactive()` method. This is similar to `ref()` but works well with objects.

```js
// src/stores/quizStore.js
<script setup>
export const state = reactive({
    name: 'My Quiz',
    questions: [
        // Quiz questions
    ],
    // other state properties...,
})
</script>
```

### When This Approach Works and When It Doesn't
---
This simple reactive store is often all you need. It's laughably simple but effective for many cases.

However, as your application grows more complex, you might encounter issues such as:

State changing unexpectedly without knowing why
Needing to hook into state changes to perform operations like updating local storage or making AJAX requests
In those cases, you might need a more flexible state management solution.
