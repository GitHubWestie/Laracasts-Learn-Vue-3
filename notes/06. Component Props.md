## Component Props
Some house keeping first. The app object can also be extracted out into it's own component like the button was. This means the app can be imported in the same way which will keep the html file much cleaner and separate the app into it's own file.
```js
// index.html
import App from "./js/components/App.js";

Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app')

// App.js
import AppButton from './AppButton.js';

export default {
    components: {
        'app-button': AppButton,
        }
    }
```

### Props
Props allow data to be passed through to the component from the outside world, making components more versatile as they can then be easily modified for a specific purpose.

The props are defined on the component:
```js
// template: ...

props: {
    type: { // This is the name of the prop
        type: String, // This is the type of the prop
        default: 'primary' // This sets a default value for the prop
    }
},

// data() ...
```

And then used in the html:
```html
<!-- Specifying the prop will override the default value -->
<app-button type="cancel">Hey üëãüèª</app-button>
```
