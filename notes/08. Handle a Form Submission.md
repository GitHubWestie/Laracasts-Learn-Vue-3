## Handle a Form Submission
To handle a form submission in Vue use the `v-on:submit=""` or shorthand `@submit=""`. The submit event listener will have to be told what to do when the form is submitted. This can be done by defining a `method:{}`.

```js
methods: {
    add() {
        alert('Submitted');
    }
}
```

By default a form submission will cause a page to refresh. The typical way around this with JavaScript is to prevent it in the method being called.

```js
methods: {
    add(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert('Submitted');
    }
}
```

And this will still work, but Vue makes it even easier by providing modifiers which can be added directly on to the @submit.

```html
<form @submit.prevent="add">
```

### Captuing Data
One approach to capture the data from the form is to use `v-model` again. By using v-model, the value of the input can be grabbed on submission. From here it can be handled however necessary for example added to a variable. In this case it will be added to the assignments array.

```js
data() {
    return {
        assignments: [
            { name: 'Finish project', complete: false, id: 1 },
            { name: 'Read chapter 4', complete: false, id: 2 },
            { name: 'Turn in homework', complete: false, id: 3 },
        ],

        newAssignment: '', // Instantiate newAssignment
    }
},

// Other code...

methods: {
    // Add the newAssignment to the assignments array
    add() {
        this.assignments.push({
            name: this.newAssignment,
            complete: false,
            id: this.assignments.length + 1,
        })

        // Return newAssignment to an empty string
        this.newAssignment: '',
    },

}
```

Because `newAssignment` now contains whatever was submitted in the form, the form input wont clear itself out like it normally would. To handle this, `newAssignment` is returned to an empty string at the end of the `add()` method.
