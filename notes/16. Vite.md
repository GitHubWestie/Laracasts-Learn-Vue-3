## Vite
[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a build tool that handles your development server and hot module replacement (HMR). HMR means that when you change a file, the browser instantly updates without a full reload. Vite also bundles your code for production to optimize performance.

### Create a Vue project with Vite
To create a new Vue 3 project with Vite, run `npm init vue@latest`, then follow the prompts to create the project.

Once setup use `npm run dev` to run the server.
