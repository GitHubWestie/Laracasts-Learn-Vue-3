## Little Confusing Things

### @Alias
Some import paths will be resolved using an alias. These are indicated by a path that starts with an `@` symbol, like this: `import HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld.vue'`

The alias will be defined in `vite.coonfig.js` like so:
```js
resolve: {
    alias: {
        '@': fileURLToPath(new URL('./src', import.meta.url))
    },
},
```

If the ide doesn't understand this then a `jsconfig.json `file can be used to inform it about the alias.
```js
"compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
},
```

As of the latest Vue install this is already done by default.

### RouterLink
The `RouterLink` allows Vue to load a page without a full refresh. The load is almost instantaneous. Anytime a page is required to load content dynamically the RouterLink should be used which will load via an `ajax` request rather than a standard request which would force a page refresh.

### RouterView
The `RouterView` component is the second piece of the puzzle and is responsible for actually displaying the intended view. It uses an array of routes defined in `index.js` to fetch the appropriate view based on the current uri.
