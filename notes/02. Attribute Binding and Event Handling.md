## Attribute Binding and Event Handling

### Attribute Binding
Vue uses `v-bind` to bind attributes to values.
```html
<button v-bind:class="buttonClasses">Click me 👆🏻</button>
```

`v-bind` also has a shorthand which is simply a colon `:`. Similar to blade template props, when this is placed before an attribute it will be evaluated as an expression.

### Event Handling
Events are detected using `v-on:` followed by the event to listen for. `v-on` also has a shorthand which is the `@`
```html
<button :class="active" v-on:click="toggle">Click me 👆🏻</button>
<button :class="active" @click="toggle">Click me 👆🏻</button>
```
These can take any expression, inline logic and even methods etc.

```js
<script>
    Vue.createApp({
        data() {
            return {
                active: false,
            };
        },

        // Methods are defined in the methods object
        methods: {
            toggle() {
                alert('Hello from the toggle!')
            } 
        }
    }).mount('#app');
</script>
```

### Options API vs. Composition API
Vue has two ways of structuring Vue components. This approach is called the `options API` and until Vue 3 was the only API available.

Vue3 introduced the `composition API` which is discussed later.
