## More Flexible Components With Slots and Flags
Currently to boot up the fake database server and make it responsive, two commands need to be run back to back. `npx serve` followed by `npx json-server db.json`. This can be bundled into a single command using the `package.json` file that was created when json-server was installed. 

Inside package.json add both commands to a `scripts` object:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npx serve & npx json-server db.json"
  },
}
```
*The single '&' is not arbitrary. This runs both commands at the same time where as a double '&&' would run them on after the other.*

### Slots
Slots work the same as other slots. If a slot is included in a component then anything placed within the component tags will be rendered in the place of the slot.

```js
// AssignmentList.js
template: `
    <section v-show="assignments.length" class="w-60">
        // ...
        <ul class="border border-gray-600 rounded-md px-4 py-3">
            <Assignment
                v-for="assignment in filteredAssignments"
                :key="assignment.id"
                :assignment="assignment"
                >
            </Assignment>
        </ul>

        <slot></slot>
    </section>
    `,

// Assignments.js
<AssignmentList>
    <h1>Hello! üëãüèª</h1>
</AssignmentList>
```
*Hello will be slotted into the AssignmentList component*

### Flags
Flags can be useful for basic conditionals. For example if a 'close' button was required on some components a flag could be used to create an attribute that can be applied to the component. For example:
```js
// AssignmentList.js

// Button to be conditionally hidden
<button v-show="canHide"></button>

props: {
    canHide: {
        type: Boolean,
        default: false
    },
}
```

Then on any instances of the component the flag can be set by simply adding the attribute. So in this example completed assignments can be hidden while incomplete assignments cannot.

```js
// Assignments.js
<AssignmentList title="Assignments" :assignments="filters.incomplete" />
<AssignmentList title="Complete" :assignments="filters.completed" canHide />
```

### Toggling Visibility
Toggling visibility is a common and useful feature. Vue provides simplified ways of achieving this but can also handle more traditional methods using event listeners.

```js
// Option one
<div v-if="show">
    <button @click="show = !show">Hide me!</button>
</div>

data() {
    return {
        show: true,
    }
}
```

```js
// Option two
// On child component
<div>
    <button @click="$emit('hide')">Hide me!</button>
</div>

// On component instance in parent
<div v-if="show" @hide="show = !show"></div>

data() {
    return {
        show: true,
    }
}
```
