## Component Responsibility
When considering how to separate things into components the responsibility of the component should be considered. For example, `assignmentList.js` now contains a whole load of logic related to tags.

A good starting point when extracting a new component is the template. A lot of the time the template will inform and give clues about what it needs to be able to function which is useful when deciding what to pass through as props, where computed properties need to live, where properties should be tracked etc.

### Inline $emits
In AssignmentCreate.js the new assignments are emitted using a `method`. Emits can also be inlined.

```html
<!-- AssignmentTags.js -->
<span @click="$emit('update', tag)">

<!-- AssignmentList.js -->
<AssignmentTags @update="currentTag = $event" />
```
