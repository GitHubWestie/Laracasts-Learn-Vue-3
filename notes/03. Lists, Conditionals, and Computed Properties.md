## Lists, Conditionals, and Computed Properties
Something to be aware of when working with Vue is where the single source of truth is. Generally speaking it should be inside Vue. Data should be defined in (or provided to) Vue and then used n the DOM rather than the DOM itself having direct access to the data.

```js
data() {
    return {
        assignments: [
            { name: 'Finish project', complete: false },
            { name: 'Read chapter 4', complete: false },
            { name: 'Turn in homework', complete: false },
        ]
    }
}
```

This data can then be used and manipulated in the DOM
```html
<h2 class="font-bold mb-2">Completed Assignments</h2>
<ul>
    <!-- The array filter() method returns only the items that return true for a given condition -->
    <li v-for="assignment in assignments.filter(a => a.complete)">
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" v-model="assignment.complete">
            {{ assignment.name }}
        </label>
    </li>
</ul>
```

### Loops and Keys
When using loops with Vue it's important to give the loop a `key`. The key helps vue keep track of each iteration and prevents weird behaviour, particularly in instances where the order of the array might change. Generally speaking though it's best practice to use a key whenever looping in Vue.

### Computed Properties
Computed properties allow for defining methods that can be used in the DOM. This can help to reduce repetition and prevent cluttering the DOM with Vue/JS logic. 

In the `options API` computed properties are defined within the Vue app.
```js
let app = {
    computed: {
        completedAssignments() {
            return this.assignments.filter(a => a.complete)
        },
        incompleteAssignments() {
            return this.assignments.filter(a => !a.complete)
        }
    }
}
```
